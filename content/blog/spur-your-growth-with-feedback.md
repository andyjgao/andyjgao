**"I don't like the article. I think you should make it shorter."**

Receiving negative feedback hurts. And even more so when you've poured your heart and soul into something. It never feels good when you're criticized for something you thought was perfect.

However, it's the secret ingredient to accelerating your growth.

I used to take criticism as a personal attack, but now I value every piece of feedback I receive.

Here's how I create my feedback loop:

## Ask and you shall receive

If people give you feedback on their own volition, that's great, but you will receive far more when you're proactive about it.

Ask for feedback.

[In my newsletter](https://mondaymail.substack.com/), I always ask for feedback. By doing this, you can collect a database of what people like and what people ignore. This will only help you because then you can create a better article/newsletter/product, which will attract a broader audience.

You may be surprised at how effective bouncing off ideas with your friends can be. They often save you plenty of time by validating a thought before you've invested hours into it.

If people thought your proposition was terrible, it doesn't mean you should give up. Instead, ask why. What they say after this is _especially_ important to collect so you can improve.

Before you start a project, when you work on your project, and when you think you've completed your project, ask for feedback. I can't stress it enough.

## Apply it

This is the most crucial part of this entire process. There's no point in spending time collecting feedback if you don't apply it.

After you've acquired a stockpile of data points, you can then start grouping by commonalities. If multiple people give you the same advice, chances are its something you need to fix and improve.

But there will always be outliers as well. These are the criticisms you should assess with a grain of salt and see if it's appropriate. Sometimes it's a key insight that not many people have noticed. Other times its just haters trying to take you down.

With the valuable feedback, you can now start making whatever project you're working on even better.

## Iterate

Feedback doesn't end after one iteration. It's a continual process in the pursuit of being better.

Once you've received your first round of feedback, go produce more projects and accept more feedback. The faster you can repeat the cycle, the better.

One way to increase the rate of feedback is to use the internet. By [creating content online](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/why-i-created-blog/), you can learn in public and create an engine of serendipity to receive feedback from people you don't even know. And even when you sleep too.

I would never be the person I am today without the feedback I received and I'd love to hear yours as well.
