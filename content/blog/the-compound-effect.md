Let's say you were given two choices: **$1,000 a month** vs. **$20/month with 10% growth each month.**

Which would you choose?

If you chose $1,000, you would be correct -- but only for five years.

In 3.5 years, Option B would yield a monthly income of $1,095.27. In 5 years, Option B's cumulative income would surpass Option A's cumulative income ($60,000 vs. $60,696.33). In roughly 5.5 years, Option B's cumulative income would have doubled Option A's.

A compound interest investment, or Option B, becomes a no-brainer. But what is the key takeaway? From Option B, we learn that growth, no matter how small, is better than stagnation in the long run.

In life, you should choose Option B. Follow a compound effect strategy toward your goals, and you will reap the rewards.

## Implementing the compound effect strategy

Darren Hardy describes it best in his book _The Compound Effect_ when he states that the compound effect strategy is doing seemingly insignificant actions consistently.

Hardy describes in his book two people who start at the same weight. One person increases his daily caloric intake by 125 calories, and the other decreasing 125 calories. While insignificant at first, after 2.5 years, one becomes fat while the other becomes skinny.

So how do you effectively implement the compound strategy?

### Breaking down goals

The next time you have a goal in mind, break it down from an enormous task into daily tasks, and you will find that it is far easier than you imagined. Imagine having a goal of reading 30 books in a year. An average book is \~[250 pages](https://www.megcabot.com/about-meg-cabot/frequently-asked-questions-getting-published/), and let's say you read 25 pages a day. In a year, you would have finished 36.5 books, even more than your original goal.

### Track your progress

Journaling your progress is equally as important when implementing the compound effect strategy. By journaling your progress, you can see when you deviate from your plan and when you are progressing effectively in your goals.

### Consistency

The most important step is consistency. Consistency is the foundation of the compound effect. You can break down your goals and track your progress, but if you are not doing this regularly, the compound effect will not happen.

**The key to implementing the compound strategy is consistency.**

This strategy works almost 100% of the time. I've used it to learn to program, read more, and reach my fitness goals.

## What's next?

Now that we've discussed how to apply the compound effect in your life, the next step is to take action. Find a goal or skill that you've always wanted to learn and break it down. Make progress on it no matter how small and you'll accomplish almost any goal.

Hopefully, by the end of quarantine, you'll have developed a new skill you always aspired to have.
