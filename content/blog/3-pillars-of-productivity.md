During college, I experimented a lot with productivity systems. I tried waking up at 4 am, using a bullet journal, etc. You name it, I've done it. 

I've come to realize that no matter what program or product you use, there are general principles that can be applied to any system.

My productivity strategy is based on three pillars: **Planning Ahead, Removing Distractions, and Maintaining Focus.**

## Planning Ahead

Planning should really be called investing your time. Just as we invest money in the stock market to increase our wealth, we should invest minutes in planning to _save hours in the future._

I split planning into Weekly Planning and Daily Planning.

### Weekly Planning

Every Sunday, I spend roughly 30 minutes to plan for the week ahead. I start by examining my project list and see what outstanding tasks I have to finish.

**_Note:_** _A Project can be replaced with a class, a course, or any large deliverable._

Afterward, I compile all of my todos into a weekly task list and assigned it to different days throughout the week.

And that's it. This simple weekly routine has drastically improved my efficiency in completing projects and has taken the mental load of figuring what I need to do each day.

### Daily Planning

Before I sleep each night, I take a look and review what needs to be done the following day (via weekly plan). This helps my mind subconsciously prepare for the next day. I make this process easier by writing down a general schedule.

I almost never adhere to the schedule exactly (life is unexpected) but it does give me a framework and time range for completing each activity. Just like weekly planning, daily planning removes the uncertainty of a day and limits [procrastination caused by abstract goals](https://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/how-to-avoid-procrastination-think.php).

## Remove Distractions

Removing distractions is absolutely essential to being productive. It takes around [23 minutes](https://www.themuse.com/advice/this-is-nuts-it-takes-nearly-30-minutes-to-refocus-after-you-get-distracted) to refocus after getting distracted, so it is in our best interest to reduce distractions as much as possible.

### Work During Off-Hours

If distractions are caused by the notifications ringing on our phone or the messages we have to respond to, working when everyone else is asleep drastically reduces the amount of minutes distracted by these hindrances. 

When you wake up earlier (or sleep a lot later), you grant yourself hours of undisturbed focus where you can do [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), a necessity when doing meaningful knowledge work.

### Separate your Work Environment

I used to work in the same room as my bed, and this made napping SO EASY. If I got stuck on a bug while programming or had writer's block, I would roll into bed and take a nap. This destroyed my productivity.

Our surroundings have a certain amount of influence on the [psychological states and choices we make.](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips) By physically separating where we work and relax, we are able to create a mental separation as well.

### No Phones

This one is simple, just don't use it. When you work, put your phone away.  A general rule of thumb is to keep it out-of-sight and 7 seconds away.

## Maintaining Focus

Now that we've created a plan, and removed distractions, the final task is to maintain focus while we work. 

### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a system where you choose a task to focus on for 25 minutes before taking a 5-minute break. After 4 cycles, you take a longer 20-minute break. Then you rinse and repeat. This strategy works because the breaks are long enough to help your mind recover from intense focus but short enough that you do not become distracted.

Currently, I use the [PomoTab](https://www.andyjgao.com/projects/pomotab/) Chrome Extension, but there are also plenty of other options online.

### Meditation

Similar to how we training our body with exercise, we train our mind with meditation. [Meditation](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/why-i-love-meditation/) helps increase the grey-matter in our brain which is directly correlated to focus and attention. Through meditation, we can increase the duration we maintain our focus on an activity.
