I never thought of myself as a writer. In school, I consistently received grades in English that would make my Asian parents fume. Yet, I started this blog.  You should create one too. 

Here's why:

### Publicize your ideas

Imagine if Albert Einstein never publicized his Theory of Relativity or if Thomas Edison kept the light bulb to himself. As a society, we would have lost a lot.

Similarly, we should publicize our ideas, as well. In Sonke Ahren's book, [How to Take Smart Notes](https://andyjgao.com/notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/), he writes that "an idea kept private is as good as one you never had." This is because, to everyone else, it is the same as if you never had the idea.

Ideas should be written down, discussed, and expressed. By publicizing them, you can keep yourself vulnerable, accountable, and open for collaboration.

### Use writing as a tool for synthesizing knowledge

You write when you text, you write when you email. Everything in life revolves around it. Whether it be studying, research, academia, or expression -- you will use writing.

When we synthesize our thoughts physically on paper, we can examine it and dissect it. Writing acts as a self-test as to whether you remember what you've learned. The next time you want to see if you understand a topic, try writing it out and see how much you know. Chances are you might remember a lot less than you thought. 

A blog is useful because publishing your work means you need to work extra hard to understand the concept you are writing about.

### Projects are essential for learning

Regardless of what skill you want to pick up, projects are crucial. They aim at narrowing your focus by giving you a goal to accomplish and a deadline to meet, allowing you to plan and execute.

Let's say I want to improve my writing. Without a project to link to this goal, it's merely a dream. I can dream all day of being the next Shakespeare, but I have no actionable plan.

I started this blog as a project to improve my writing.

### A way to document my self as I evolve

Every day, I absorb content through books, articles, tweets, etc. As I interact with these mediums, my beliefs and views change as well. Through this blog, I hope to be able to document this journey as I grow. Five years ago, I was different from who I am now. Five years later, I will be different too.

### Why you should create a blog too

The reasons I listed above are why I created this website, but they can also pertain to you as well! To recap, you should create a blog because:

* Publicizing your ideas keeps you vulnerable, accountable, and open for collaboration.
* Writing is the best way to synthesize knowledge.
* Creating projects are the best way to learn.
* It provides you a way to document your growth.

And the best part is **it's free**!
