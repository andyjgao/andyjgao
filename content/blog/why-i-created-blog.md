I started this blog and you should create one too. Here's why:

### Publicize your Ideas

We would not be in such an advanced society if everyone kept their thoughts to themselves. Imagine if Albert Einstein never publicized his ideas on the Theory of Relativity or if Thomas Edison decided to keep his light bulb to himself. As humans, we would have lost a lot.

Similarly, we should publicize our ideas as well. In Sonke Ahren's book, [How to Take Smart Notes](https://andyjgao.com/notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/), he writes that "an idea kept private is as good as one you never had". This is because to everyone else, it is the same as if you never had the idea.

Ideas are meant to be written down, discussed, and expressed. By publicizing them, you can keep yourself vulnerable, accountable and open for collaboration.

### Use writing as a tool for synthesizing knowledge

You write when you text, you write when you email. Everything in life revolves around it. Whether it be studying, research, academia or expression -- writing is used.

When we synthesize our thoughts physically on paper, we can examine it and dissect it. It acts as a self-test as to whether you remember what you've learned. The next time you want to see if you understand a topic, try writing it out and see how much you know. Chances are you might know a lot less than you thought. This is because often being familiar with a topic is an illusion for understanding a topic.

A blog is useful because publishing your work means you need to work extra hard to understand the topic you are writing about.

### Projects are essential for learning

Regardless of what skill you want to pick up, projects are absolutely essential. They are aimed at narrowing your focus by giving you a goal to accomplish and a deadline to meet, allowing you to plan and execute.

Projects can also give you a place to immediately apply the concepts you've learned.

Let's say I want to improve my writing. Without a project to link to this goal, it's simply a dream. I can dream all day of being the next Shakespeare, but I am left with no actionable plan.

I started this blog as a project to improve my writing with each post becoming a task to be accomplished.

### A way to document my self as I evolve

Every day, I absorb content through books, articles, tweets, etc. As I interact with these mediums, my beliefs and views naturally change as well. Through this blog, I hope to be able to document this journey as I grow as an individual. Five years ago, I was different from who I am now. Five years later, I will be different too.

### Why you should create a Blog too

The reasons I listed above are why I created this website, but they can also pertain to you as well! To recap, You should create a blog because:

* **Publicizing your ideas** keeps you vulnerable, accountable and open for collaboration
* **Writing is the best way to synthesize knowledge**
* Creating **projects are the best way to learn**
* It provides you **a way to document your growth**

And the best part is **it's Free**! (using the proper methods).
