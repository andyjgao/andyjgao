Are you reading this article while you should be working? Distracted by your phone again while studying?

Chances are that if you aren't doing it now, you've definitely done it before in the past. Luckily, there's a proven method to mitigate this problem (and no it's not Adderall).

The answer lies in **Meditation**.

## What is Meditation?

While there are many ways to define meditation, in its essence, the practice of meditation is a way to exercise the mind--concentrating your focus on something small (breath, pebble, movement of grass), noting when your mind wanders and letting go. Just as physical exercise increases the capabilities of the body, mental exercise increases the capability of the mind's awareness, attention, clarity, etc.

At first, I was skeptical of this practice. Can closing your eyes and saying "om" for a fixed duration really increase your ability to focus? It seemed rather unlikely. For the longest time, I was in this pool as well. _There was no way meditation would work_.

This was not until my university started offering a free subscription for Head Space, a meditation app. It advertised itself as an app to _help_ _people sleep better, stress less and focus more in just 5 minutes_.

I decided to give it a shot spending 5 minutes each day for a week. At worse, I wasted 5 minutes every day which I already did while watching YouTube. At best, I could gain the benefits promoted by [Headspace]().

After a week, I noticed my mind becoming calmer.

After a month, I was blown away.

This experience made me throw away any preconceived notions and jump-start my journey into meditation. After a year and a half, I noticed some distinguishable benefits.

## Benefits of Meditation

While I can continue to harp on the benefits through my personal anecdotes, I found it more convincing if I proved it through scientific studies as well. Meditation will help you develop ...

### Improved Focus and School Performance

A [study]() conducted by UC Davis showed that after meditation, subjects were able to maintain focus even during monotonous tasks. This means no more checking Instagram every five minutes while pulling your all-nighter and actually sleeping at a godly hour.

Being able to focus translates to the classroom as well. [Meditating for even just six minutes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130409131811.htm) before a lecture has shown to boost test scores as it leads to better focus and retention throughout the class.

### Improved Sleep

Racing thoughts are a common occurrence for those who deal with insomnia. Mindfulness training via meditation helps provide a way to "turn off" the noise in the mind by focusing on the present, leading to [faster and higher quality sleep](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mindfulness-meditation-helps-fight-insomnia-improves-sleep-201502187726). For long term meditators, meditation can even [reduce total sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2919439/) time needed to function at a high level.

### Improved Social/Self-Awareness

The main problem causing lack of social awareness is the inability to be in the present due to a myriad of issues -- anxiety, stress, etc. As a result, you become stuck in your head instead of focusing on a conversation or activity. With continual meditation, you are able to [increase the grey-matter density](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533210107311624) in the brain associated with awareness and compassion. This fortifies your ability to stay present and not get distracted by your negative emotions.

### Improved Happiness

If not for anything else, Meditation [helps with happiness](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeenacho/2016/03/05/increase-happiness-and-sense-of-well-being-through-meditation/#59a058a22adb). Through meditation, you are able to [thicken the area of your brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/) that copes with stress and difficult situations, which strengthens your emotional stability and overall emotional health.

## How Do You Meditate?

So now that we've discussed _what meditation is_ and _why you should meditate_, the only thing left is _how to do it_. The practice of deliberate mindfulness is very simple to get started and all it requires is 5-10 minutes of your day. Here are the steps:

1. **Find a comfortable spot and sit down.** At this time, you should take a couple of deep breaths and relax your mind and body.
2. **Find an object to focus your mind on.** This could be your breath or even a pebble. If you choose your breath, I recommend closing your eyes to remove visible distractions around you.
3. **As you focus, you may notice that your mind wanders.** This is completely okay--simply note it and refocus your mind. The more you do this, the longer you will be able to focus without your mind wandering.

Meditating is easy, mastering it is hard. Thus, I suggest using [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/ "url: https://www.headspace.com/"). (I am not sponsored in any way, I just love the app). It provides guided meditations that keep you on track with the steps mentioned above and allows you to smoothly transition from a newbie to a more advanced meditation.
