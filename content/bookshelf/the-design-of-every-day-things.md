## Review

The book has a lot of novel concepts that will change the way you think about design and the everyday objects around you. It also touches upon the psychology of design and how to design with a more human-centered approach. Overall, a really good book to learn about design but unfortunately, at times, a bit redundant. For a book that focuses on design, it's ironic that the structure of the book is poorly designed. 

## Notes

### The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

Good Design requires both discoverability and understanding.

* **Discoverability** is figuring out the possible actions of the product.
* **Understanding** is how the product is supposed to be used.

Everyone is a designer; all artificial things are designed-- whether it be the layout of your room or the mechanics of a microwave.

##### 3 Design Focuses emphasized in this book:

* **Industrial design:** Optimizing function, value, and appearance of the product for both user and manufacturer
* **Interaction design:** Focusing on usability and understanding of a product
* **Experience design:** Focusing on emotional impact and enjoyment of a product

Design requires both an understanding of technology and psychology. Engineers who design products often fall into the pitfall of designing products that are too logical and not accounting for human error. Good design accounts for human error and behavior

**Human-Centered Design (HCD)** solves the problem of design products that are too logical. HCD is the process of assessing human needs first and then designing to match those needs.

**Good Designers produce pleasurable experiences**. This will determine how someone remembers their interaction. Understanding a product **=>** positive emotions **=>** good experience

##### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

* **Affordances:** actions possible between an object and someone interacting with it. (ie: A chair "affords" sitting on. It also "affords" being picked up if it's very light.)
  * Visible affordances provide strong clues to possible actions (flat plate on door affords pushing) and can act as signifiers sometimes.
  * If affordance cannot be perceived a signifier is needed.
* **Signifiers:** communicate where actions are possible and should take place. MUST BE perceivable, else useless. (eg: A "PUSH" sign on a door signals that is where you should push)
  * Signifiers are more important than Affordances because they communicate how to use the design
* **Mapping:** the relationship between the elements of two sets of things. (eg: a switch & lights, the steering wheel & car wheel)
  * Spatial correspondence leads to immediate understanding (the left switch turns on the left light etc.)
* **Feedback:** Communicating the results of an action (eg: a traffic light saying "Wait" to acknowledge you pressed the cross button)
  * Feedback must be
    * Immediate - delay will lose people's attention and waste resource as a result
    * Informative - poor feedback is worse than no feedback (distracting and annoying)
    * Planned - actions need to be confirmed, but unobtrusive
    * Prioritized - important info captures attention but unimportant info is displayed subtly
* **Conceptual Models:** a simplified explanation of how something works (eg: file folders in computers are a conceptual model for retrieving info on computer)
  * A good conceptual model leads to understanding
  * A poor conceptual model leads to confusion and frustration => bad product

**Good Design requires good communication** especially from machine to human such as possible actions, what is happening, what will happen

The **system image** is the explicit and implicit instructions of a product that helps users form a conceptual model.

### The Psychology of Everyday Actions

When people use a product they face Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Action :

* The **Gulf of Execution** is the process of figuring how something operates. It's bridged through signifiers, constraints, mappings and good conceptual model
* The **Gulf of Evaluation** is figuring out what happened and determining how well expectations met intention. It's Bridged through feedback and a good conceptual model

There are a total of 7 stages of action when using a product:

1. Form **Goal**
   * To find a goal try and use _root cause analysis_, ask the purpose of your action until you find a fundamental cause for activity.
2. **Plan** the action
3. **Specify** the action sequence
4. **Perform** the action sequence
5. **Perceive** the state of the world
6. **Interpret** perception
7. **Compare** outcome with Goal

**Emotions are just as important as cognition.** Cognition provides understanding, emotion provides value judgment (ie making decisions). Without cognition, you would have difficulty functioning in the world. Without emotion, you wouldn't be able to make choices on subjective items.

A useful model to approximate cognition & emotion processes in 3 stages:

* **Visceral: lizard brain** (subconscious) These are quick and subconscious responses learned through conditioning and unaffected by context (eg: fear of heights, love of chocolate)
  * When designing for Visceral, use aesthetics & first impressions
* **Behavioral: learned brain** (subconscious) These are actions we learned but are unaware of underlying details (e.g. lifting a finger, kicking a ball)
  * When designing for Behavioral, match the expectation of actions. (eg: if you flip the on switch, it should turn on) Feedback is crucial for managing expectations.
* **Reflective: conscious brain** The conscious cognition is where deep understanding and decision-making take place (e.g. reflecting on past events, assessing blame or responsibility)
  * When designing for Reflective, you need to create an overall positive experience (hardest to design and most abstract)
* **All three levels of cognition are intertwined**: a good design for behavioral levels lead to strong emotional responses that will affect the reflective level

**People use storytelling to explain cause and effects** (e.g. conceptual models), by using past experiences to navigate the future, often erroneously.

**People blame the wrong things due to a faulty conceptual model** made worse with the lack of feedback. (e.g. repeating actions when there's no response, blaming yourself for a faulty machine)

Inappropriate attribution of faults is also caused by learned helplessness and taught helplessness:

* **Learned helplessness** Helplessness brought upon repeat failure of task
* **Taught helplessness**  Poorly designed classes & teacher

7 Fundamental Principles of Design

* **Discoverability**
* **Feedback**
* **Conceptual Model**
* **Affordances**
* **Signifiers**
* **Mappings**
* **Constraints**- providing physical/logical/etc restrictions to guide action and ease interpretations

### Knowledge in the Head and in the World

Precise behavior can arise from imprecise knowledge. How?

* **Natural constraints** (physical limitations of possible behavior) and cultural constraints (learned restrictions on behavior) that exist in the world which limit choice
* **Knowledge in head & world help guide behavior**
  * In the head: knowledge memorized (STOP sign means stop)
  * In the world: intuitive knowledge based on hints in the environment through signifiers, natural mappings, constraints (left light switch turns on left light)

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FjxFmVYa9w4.png?alt=media&token=88e1ff46-3a9b-4bb0-9259-426e17fca1ce)

The best designs combine both knowledge in the head & in the world to minimize learning time of a product

However, precision is required when mental models already exist -- until user adjusts.

* Example: There needs to be a clear distinction between newly introduced currency and old currency or else confusion will ensue.

**Short-term memory** is information retained automatically. It's severely limited often only holding 3-7 items max.

* **Design implications:** We can mitigate short-term memory by using multiple sensory modalities. This is done by splitting information between auditory, visuals, and haptic sensors. That way we can process information in parallel and amplifying memory constraint

**Long-term memory** takes time & effort to remember and is split between:

* **Arbitrary memory:** memorization of knowledge with no underlying structure (e.g. alphabet)
* **Meaningful memory:** memorization of knowledge with structure and is a lot easier to remember (pulling left handlebar to signal left)
* **Design implications:** provide meaningful structure will put knowledge in the world and make memory unnecessary

Simplified model is key for a successful application and user adoption because they allow us to remember and understand quicker.

* "Good enough" approximations are all we need for most practical purposes and greatly increases retrieval time.

Good Mapping helps put knowledge out in the world and makes design intuitive.

* Best Mapping: Controls are mounted on an item
* 2nd Best Mapping: Controls are as close as possible to item
* 3rd Best Mapping: Spatial configuration and controls and items are same

Mappings can also be heavily dependent on culture (e.g. different lanes for driving based on country)

### Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback

**Constraints are the limitations of actions** and are useful in providing clues when faced with unfamiliar situations.

There are 4 types of constraints:

* **Physical** Caused by physical limitations of certain objects.
  * Example: A circular hole physically constrains the action of inserting a square tube.
* **Cultural** Caused by social norms
  * Example: A person is culturally constrained from sitting in an elevator
* **Semantic** Caused by the context of a given situation
  * Example: A person is semantically constrained to face forward when riding a motorcycle
* **Logical** Caused by logical deduction of proper actions.
  * Example: A person uses logical constraints to deduce that numbered items should be ordered chronologically.

Constraints that force behavior:

* **Interlocks** Force operations to take place in proper sequence
  * Example: A car prevents you from leaving the Park position unless the car's brake pedal is pressed.
* **Lock-ins**  Prevents an action from prematurely ending
  * Example: When exiting an application, there is always a message prompt to confirm action
  * Lock-ins can also be uses as a business design strategy. Apple uses a lock-in strategy by having their products work harmoniously with each other.
* **Lock-outs** Prevents an action from occurring
  * Safety pin on a fire extinguisher is a lock-out to prevent accidental discharge
  * It's important to make sure lock-outs are not nuisances or else people will disable them.

**Perceived affordances** **-- such as knowing a doorknob is used to turn -- are based off of cultural convention and learned behavior.** These cultural conventions create cultural constrains on objects. While most times conventions help provide guidance for novel situations, it also makes it difficult to enact change.

* Example: The English measurement system is used in 3 countries (USA, Liberia, Myanmar) due to cultural convention although the metric system is far easier to use.

When designing a product, adhere to the following principles:

* **Visible affordances and signifiers**
* **Discoverability**
* **Immediacy of feedback**
* If you can't adhere to these principles, use the principle of desperation: **Standardization**. Users then only need to learn once.

### Human Error? No, Bad Design

All systematic failures should be treated in the same way: find the fundamental cause & redesign system so that the problem is resolved. Instead, we often blame and punish humans instead of fixing the root cause

We must use Root Cause analysis instead. When searching for the cause of an error, we need to investigate until the single,underlying cause is found -- not until we find discover the human error in the chain.

* A good aid in performing root cause analysis is to use the "Five Why's" method-- when a reason is found, continue to ask why until at least five why's are answered. (5 is arbitrary but it is a good basis to use)

**Errors** are deviations from appropriate behavior.

There are two types of errors:

* **Slips:** a person performs an unintended action.
* **Mistakes:** a person establishes the wrong plan and completes the wrong goal

Slips can be:

* **Capture Slips:** A more frequently performed activity accidentally replaces a desired action
  * Example: When counting cards, you count to 13 instead of listing out the face cards
  * To design against this: sequences should differ from the start of a process
* **Description-similarity Slips:** an action is erroneously performed on a similar object.
  * Example: Pouring salt into coffee instead of sugar
  * To design against this: Objects with different purposes must be easily distinguishable
* **Memory-Lapse Slips:** the wrong/lack of action is performed due to memory failure
  * Example: Forgetting a credit card in ATM after withdrawing money
  * To design against this: use forcing functions, minimize steps between plan and goal, and provide vivid reminders.
* **Mode-Error Slips:** an action is performed on the wrong mode
  * Example: Turning off the wrong system in a multi-purpose remote
  * To design against this: remove modes when possible and when they exist, make the mode obvious

Mistakes can be:

* **Rule-based mistakes:** the wrong rule is used in a situation either due to improper classification of goal, faulty rules, or improper evaluation of rules
  * Example: Many people died in a nightclub when a fire erupted because the guards were instructed to not let people out if they did not pay for drinks. (Faulty rules)
  * To design against this: Provide as much guidance to ensure the current state is displayed in an easy to understand format (usually graphical).
* **Knowledge-based mistakes:** Incorrect diagnosis of the situation due to erroneous or incomplete knowledge
  * Example: Assembling a table incorrectly.
  * To design against this: Help users build as good of a conceptual model as possible
* **Memory-Lapse mistakes:** forgetting goal or plan of action usually caused by sudden interruption during activity.
  * Example: Boiling water to make tea but an interruption causes you to forget why you are boiling water.
  * To design against this: Provide continuously available information throughout the duration of a task.

A major source of errors come from interruptions. The cost of interruptions is far greater than the loss of time required to deal with the interruption. The cost of resuming interrupted activity must also be factored.

**How to Design for Error:**

* Adding constraints to block error
* Create an Undo command when possible
* Design sensibility checks to prevent actions that do not make sense
* Minimize slips by providing perceptible feedback of performed action and new state
* Make errors easy to discover and easy to correct

### Design Thinking

When given a problem, we need to ask whether the problem we are solving is the correct one. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all.

**Design Thinking**- the process of taking a given problem as a suggestion and searching for a root cause instead. Once the root cause is found, then potential solutions are offered.

Two Tool for better Design Thinking:

* **The Double Diamond Model of Design**
  * The first half focuses on finding the right problem, the second half focuses on finding the right solution.
  * This model ensures proper exploration of problems & solutions but still proposes a convergence deadline for progress.![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FQ12r1Y6S3Z.png?alt=media&token=77fabaa3-8c1b-400a-9778-c244ab52c0cc)
* **The Human-Centered Design Process:**
  1. **Observe**
     * Understanding the behavior and needs of a potential customer in order to tackle the correct problem
  2. **Idea Generation**
     * When a problem is determined, we reach a phase of idea generation. Ideas should not be constrained and should be mercilessly questioned.
  3. **Prototyping**
     * Once an idea is determined, prototypes are used to confirm if the idea is reasonable
     * "Wizard of Oz" is a prototyping method where a human manually mimics a system/feature to test feasibility.
  4. **Testing**
     * Testing should be done in a group as similar to target demographic as possible
     * When testing, a good rule of thumb is to test 5 at a time. This provides enough information to get major findings, then testing should be iterated for rapid feedback.
  5. **Iteration**
     * Requirements are rarely right on the first try. Thus, we need iteration for rapid development. "Fail Fast, Fail Frequently" - David Kelley
     * This can go on forever and is thus constrained by time and budget.

**Design for activities and not for tasks.**

* Activities are a high-level structure (going shopping) while tasks are an individual action (getting milk).
* Apple's iPod was successful because they designed for the activity of listening to music--discovering new music, creating playlists, connecting to external speakers etc. --as opposed to just creating a device that plays music.

**Iterative Design vs Linear Design**

* **Iterative Design** (Scrum, Agile) is cyclical and creates a product that matches people's needs better but is very slow and costly
* **Linear Design** (Waterfall Method) is very sequential-- each stage of design is completed after approval from manager -- which leads to faster completion of products.
* We need a combination of both in the real world.

The best teams are multi-disciplinary to account for the viewpoints of all disciplines in the product development process.

### Design in the World of Business

Good design principles are easy in theory, hard in practice.

**Feature Creep** The continuous addition of new features, most of them unnecessary.

* **Cause of feature creep:**
  * Existing customers wishing for more features
  * Competition adds new features pressuring you to do the same
  * Declining sales from saturated market forces new features for profit
* **How to fix feature creep:**
  * Don't go blindly into matching competitors feature for feature
  * Focus on strengthening your strengths, instead of worrying about weaknesses. This will give your product a competitive edge.
  * The irrelevant weakness can be ignored, and the others can be made "good enough"

Technology changes rapidly, but people & culture change slowly because people are dictated by convention. Shifting it requires time, effort, and convincing.

* Example: The QWERTY keyboard is not optimized for typing but is still the convention of today because of convention

Ideas are rarely bad, just too early.

* Example: Apple was one of the first to create a digital camera, but it flopped because it was too early and there was no user adoption.

There are two forms of product innovation, Incremental and Radical. We need both.

* **Incremental Innovation** - iterations on a product until it reaches its best form. This is known as hill climbing. Incremental innovations limit us to the local maxima of the hill we are on.
* In order to find a better (or worse) hill, we need radical innovation.
* **Radical Innovation** Ideas that start from fresh, often driven by the possibilities of new technology.
* Incremental innovations occur by the millions each year.
* Most radical innovation fail, but the ones that last change lives and industries
