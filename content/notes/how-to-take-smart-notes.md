## Review
An amazing book for those trying to improve their note-taking skills. If you've ever had trouble recalling the main concepts of a book to a friend when they ask about the key takeaways, this book is for you. How to Take Smart Notes introduces the "zettelkasten" method, which gives you a guide to retain what you've learned from a book and apply it in the future as a reference for articles, essays, etc.

## Notes


Pushing through doing something you don't want to is not only bad for your morale but also your productivity and success. Pivoting, whether it be a thesis or a startup idea, leads to better ideas you are actually motivated about and allows you to stay in control. Staying stuck on an idea leads to stagnation.	

Simplicity is key. Over-engineering is not only costly but wastes a lot of time. (Reference Russian vs American strategy of developing anti-gravity writing tool).
There is this story where NASA tried to figure out how to make a ballpoint pen that works in space. If you have ever tried to use a ballpoint pen over your head, you have probably realized it is gravity that keeps the ink flowing. After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested, NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, Which pushes the ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils.

The best solutions remove excess features and reduce distractions from the main work.

A private idea is as good as no idea at all. Ideas and thoughts are meant to be written down and discussed and expressed.

Everything in life revolves around writing. It is the tool used for studying, research, academia, expression. Do as if NOTHING counts other than writing.

There are three types of notes when taking smart notes. The first are fleeting notes. Fleeting Notes are temporary and used as a reminder for information. These notes will live for 1-2 days until you convert them to Permanent notes. Permanent Notes live forever in your second brain (slip-box) and are written meticulously and in full sentences so that they will be understandable even with the context completely removed. Lastly, there are project notes, which are project specific notes, which are taken from permanent notes and used for the purpose of a project only. These notes are stored in the project folder.

Having to brainstorm for excess amounts of time is the byproduct of poor note-taking. You should have more ideas than you can deal with instead of scratching your brain to push out a single idea.

Long-term productivity comes from a good workflow. This means that the work itself begins to energize us and carries us through the duration of the process. This concept is known as Flow and is the state one gets into when times fly while working on something.

Motivation is a limited resource and as such cannot be relied on to propel us forward through work.

Multitasking is a terrible idea. Studies show that multi-taskers when compared to those who do tasks one at a time, are not only far less efficient but also produce work at a far worse quality. Tackling multitasking is done through having a clear definitive structure between tasks.

Try to be an expert and not a planner. An expert internalizes the rules and can act accordingly while planners get stuck when a situation does not go according to plan.

Understanding is always better than remembering. If we are given 7 numbers to remember in 30 seconds, there is a good chance you will forget one. If we find a pattern between these 7 numbers, remembering requires simply understanding that 1 pattern.

Unfinished tasks will continue to bother us subconsciously until we "mentally" check them off by writing it down. Conversely, if not written down, we have deliberately keep a mental task/question in our head subconsciously to ruminate on.

Write notes so that even without context, it makes sense. A common beginner mistake is to simply UNDERLINE or Highlight and extract quotes
Taking notes by hand is BETTER than using a keyboard because your hand cannot physically copy everything in a lecture. As a result, you are forced to translate what is being said, or essentially understand and write in your own words.

Confirmation Bias hinders an open mind as it makes us selectively filter out content that does not support our beliefs. This leads us to become ignorant of new ideas and facts/logic.

The Slip-box System or zettelkasten system tackles confirmation bias because when taking notes we are objectively collecting facts without a hypothesis in mind. If insight becomes a threat to your academic writing you are doing it wrong. You must develop your ideas from the bottom-up.

There is a difference between familiarity and understanding. Familiarity is when you recognize a concept. Understanding comes when we can explain a concept using our own words.

Learning is hard work-- You need to put in work to make meaningful connections to concepts. If connections are pre-arranged, we are robbed of the work needed to form our own connections. Just like fast food-- it is neither nutritious or enjoyable, only convenient.

Elaboration is a very good learning tool because it makes you really think about what you have read, analyze it, and figure out how it can be combined with other information to create new insights.

Cramming is one of the largest detractors to learning because it prevents us from making meaningful connections and forces us to resort to remembering information as opposed to understanding.

Our mind learns and remembers things via connections. 

There are two important reference notes needed according to Luhmen:
- Overview of a Topic (Head Notes)- Used as an entry point for other notes
- Note-to-Note references
