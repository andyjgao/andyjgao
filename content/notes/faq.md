My book notes are always growing! As I finish reading each book, I will upload them to my [notes page](/notes/). The following is a guide and some commonly asked questions on how to use these notes.

### Why did you make a notes page?
When I tell people I like to read, the first thing they ask for are book recommendations. By making this notes page, I will be able to simply refer them here.

I also made this page mainly for myself as a way to consolidate all the insights I acquired while reading a book. Most times, when I read, I pick up a lot of **Just-In-Case knowledge** that are hard to apply at the time of reading. However, this may change somewhere down the line and become **Just-In-Time knowledge**. By creating these notes, I will be able to reference the insights I developed in the past without having the reread a book.

### How do I use these notes?
My notes offer a glimpse into what a book offers by summarizing key points, and hopefully giving you a taste of what a book is like. I still strongly recommend you to read the real book if you find one of my notes interesting, and instead use what I have written as a supplement to the real deal.

### What tools do you use to take these notes?
I use [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and the zettelkasten method described in the book [How to Take Smart Notes](/notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/). 
Nat Eliason wrote a [fantastic article](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam) on why Roam Research is so powerful and Shu Omi made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljyo_WAJevQ) on how to implement zettelkasten inside Roam.

### What do the ratings mean?
All opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of anyone else who read this book.

**5-** This is a life changing book that **YOU MUST READ**. I recommend this book to everyone and their mothers.

**4-** This book is very well written and I would strongly recommend reading. It is well written and provides valuable insights backed by substance.

**3-** This book is simply average. The book has valueable insights but may lack in delivery

**2-** This book lacks substance. There may be a few valueable insights.

**1-** This book is terrible. I either did not finish or will never read again.

### Does this cost anything?
No. This is free.
