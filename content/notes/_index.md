I enjoy reading in my free time, but I've come to realize that I forget what I read after 2-3 weeks. Thus, I've decided to take notes of every book I read from now on. 

Drawing from the inspirations of [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/book), [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/notes), and [Dean Yeong](https://deanyeong.com/reading-notes/), I want to publicize my notes as well. Below, you will find a **review**, a **rating**, and **important highlights** pulled from each book.

Questions on how to use these notes? Check the [FAQ](/notes/faq).
