I like [reading](https://andyjgao.com/notes), fitness, making Youtube Videos, [traveling](https://itsamyandandy.xyz/), coming up with new business ideas, and **learning by doing**.

I [write](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/) about productivity, tech tips, entrepreneurship, personal finance, and more.

Each week, I spend roughly 10-15 hours consuming books, articles, podcasts, and tweets. Then every Monday, I send the most interesting things I've learned in my [newsletter](https://mondaymail.substack.com). If you're curious at all, feel free to subscribe below.
