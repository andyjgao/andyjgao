I like [reading](https://andyjgao.com/notes), fitness, making Youtube Videos, [traveling](https://itsamyandandy.xyz/), coming up with new business ideas, and **learning by doing**.

I [write](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/) weekly (sometimes more) about productivity, tech tips, entrepreneurship, personal finance, and more.

Each week, I spend roughly 5-15 hours consuming books, articles, podcasts, and tweets. Then, every Monday, I send an email of the most interesting things I've learned to my email subscribers.
