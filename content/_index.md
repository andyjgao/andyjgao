I'm an incoming software engineer [@Better Mortgage](better.com). I like [reading](https://andyjgao.com/notes), fitness, making Youtube Videos, [traveling](https://itsamyandandy.xyz/), and coming up with new business ideas.

I [write](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/) weekly (sometimes more) about productivity, tech tips, entrepreneurship, personal finance, and more.

Every Monday, I send an email summarizing the most interesting things I've learned as well as any articles I've posted the previous week. Subscribe below!
