Below is an Impossible List inspired by [Joel Runyon's own list](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/). The goal of an Impossible List is to create tasks that "seem" impossible at the moment, but will one become feasible as I grow. Everything item I put below is meant to push my boundaries and limit. However, it's important to note that **this list [is not a bucket list](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/).** As I check things off, the list will change and evolve to match my new limits.
