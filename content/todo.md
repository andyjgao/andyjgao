Below is an Impossible List inspired by [Joel Runyon's own list](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/). The goal is to create tasks that "seem" impossible at the moment, but will become feasible as I grow. Every bullet is meant to push my boundaries and limits. However, it's important to note that **this** [**is not a bucket list**](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/)**.** As I check things off, the list will change and evolve.
